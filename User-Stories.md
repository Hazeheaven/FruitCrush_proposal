**User Story 1**

As a Player, I want to be able to do/use special events/abilities, so that I can have a different type of gameplay.

Acceptance Criteria 1: The player can use a cutting combo on certain levels but they don’t get to choose what they get.  
Acceptance Criteria 2: The game gives the player a spin every 50 levels or on limited levels for every 50 levels you can get 1 of 4 abilities, one that cuts half of the level in half and makes it easier to finish, the next one would cut/destroy the fruits and depending how many there are it will give you a certain amount of points, for the third one it doubles all cutting points to finish the level easier/faster, for the final one which would be super rare it would cut every fruit possible of a certain fruit for 5-10 seconds and gives 4x points for those fruits getting cut by the ability.
