🕹️ Level 1: Title & Hook

**Fruit Crush**

**Candy Crush with fruits instead**

🕹️ Level 2: Choose Your Genre

Level-based | Branching paths | Puzzle-solving |

It is going to continuously go on with different levels

🕹️ Level 5: Target Market / Audience

Anyone can play but it would most likely be for younger people

🕹️ Level 6: Player Motivations

In the level based one they get extra challenging levels and in endless they get rewards the further they go

🕹️ Level 7: Unique Selling Point (USP)

There will be power ups and lore to keep the game interesting and make sure it isn’t repetitive

🕹️ Level 8: Inspirations & Competition

Fruit Ninja, Candy Crush and Block Blast, I replace the candy’s with fruit and destroy them like in candy crush for block blast the endless mode wouldn’t have you hop to the next level like in candy crush it would just automatically start you in the next part

It would most likely be competing with Candy Crush

🕹️ Level 9: Goals  
I would hope they would have fun and enjoy the game
